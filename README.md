# PulsarTimingAnalysis

The intention of this repository is to present a package with all the tools needed to perform the periodicity analysis of pulsars at Very High Energy using Python and focusing on the LST-1 telescope analysis chain:
  1. Modelling and calculation of phases 
  2. Statistics and search for pulsations


# Installation
The easiest way to install the package is by cloning the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/alvmas/PulsarTimingAnalysis.git
cd PulsarTimingAnalysis
pip install .
```
